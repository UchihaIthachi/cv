\nointent Built a full-stack decentralized application (DApp) enabling end-to-end shipment tracking and secure escrow payments on the Ethereum blockchain (Polygon Amoy Testnet). 
 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Developed a production-grade Solidity smart contract (\texttt{Tracking.sol}) using \texttt{structs}, \texttt{mappings}, and a strict 3-state \texttt{enum} lifecycle (PENDING → IN\_TRANSIT → DELIVERED), complete with guarded state transitions, timestamped event logs, and full on-chain auditability. 
    \item Implemented a trustless escrow mechanism using \texttt{payable} functions—validating \texttt{msg.value}, locking funds on creation, and releasing payments only upon verified delivery via \texttt{completeShipment}. 
    \item Built a responsive Next.js/React frontend powered by a global \texttt{TrackingContext}, providing real-time state management, shipment inspection, and lifecycle actions (create, start, complete). 
    \item Integrated \texttt{Ethers.js} and \texttt{Web3Modal} for secure wallet connection, dynamic provider/signer selection, MetaMask interaction, and seamless network handling (Localhost ↔ Polygon Amoy). 
    \item Added data-formatting utilities for user-friendly display, including UNIX→date conversion and Ether/Wei transformations using \texttt{ethers.utils.formatEther}. 
    \item Implemented polished UI/UX behaviors—loading indicators, masked modals (\texttt{maskClosable=false}), and utility helpers (\texttt{shortenAddress}, \texttt{copyToClipboard}) for high-quality user interaction. 
    \item Designed a manual CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate contract deployment (with pre-flight balance checks) and frontend deployment to Vercel, fully parameterized via GitHub Secrets and environment isolation. 
    \item Utilized Hardhat for development, including local blockchain simulation (\texttt{npx hardhat node}), compilation, contract verification, and controlled deployment workflows. 
\end{itemize}
