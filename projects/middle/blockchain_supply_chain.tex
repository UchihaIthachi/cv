\nointent \subsection*{Blockchain Supply Chain Management DApp} 
 
\nointent Built a full-stack decentralized application (DApp) enabling end-to-end shipment tracking and secure escrow payments on the Ethereum blockchain (Polygon Amoy Testnet). 
 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Developed a production-grade Solidity smart contract with a strict 3-state lifecycle (PENDING → IN\_TRANSIT → DELIVERED) and on-chain auditability. 
    \item Implemented a trustless escrow mechanism that locks funds on creation and releases payments only upon verified delivery. 
    \item Built a responsive Next.js/React frontend with global state management and Ethers.js integration for secure wallet connections. 
    \item Designed a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate contract and frontend deployment, utilizing Hardhat for local simulation and verification. 
\end{itemize}
