\nointent
Built a decentralized shipment tracking and payment platform that leverages Ethereum smart contracts to bring transparency and automation to supply chains.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented a Solidity smart contract (Tracking.sol) to model shipments with a full lifecycle (PENDING → IN_TRANSIT → DELIVERED), including timestamped events and on-chain auditability.
    \item Designed an escrow-style payment flow where receivers pre-pay shipment fees into the contract and funds are automatically released to senders upon successful delivery.
    \item Developed a Next.js/React dashboard that integrates with MetaMask via Ethers.js and Web3Modal, enabling users to create, start, complete, and inspect shipments directly from the browser.
    \item Used Hardhat for local blockchain development, automated deployment scripts, and a test suite (Mocha/Chai) to validate lifecycle transitions, event emission, and payment correctness.
\end{itemize}
