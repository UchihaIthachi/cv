Built a scalable, event-driven food delivery platform inspired by systems like Uber Eats, using a modern microservices architecture. As part of the core team, I focused on designing and developing the Restaurant Service.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed the Restaurant Module with secure sign-up/login using \textbf{Spring Security} and \textbf{JWT} (with extended claims).
    \item Built CRUD APIs for menu and item management; integrated \textbf{Redis caching} to improve performance and reduce database load, with appropriate cache invalidation strategies.
    \item Enabled order sync via \textbf{Kafka}: when an order is placed, an event is published to the `order\_created` topic, which the restaurant service consumes to update order details.
\end{itemize}
