\subsection*{RPAL Interpreter – Functional Language Compiler \href{https://github.com/malinduGamage/RPAL-Interpreter}{\faGithub}}
Engineered a complete compiler and interpreter for the RPAL (Right-reference Pedagogic Algorithmic Language), built from scratch to parse and evaluate programs according to official language grammar and semantics.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a Lexical Analyzer using custom Finite State Automata (FSA) and regex-based token identification.
    \item Built an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and Standard Tree (ST) generator.
    \item Implemented a CSE Machine to evaluate programs using 13 semantic rules of RPAL.
    \item Built a robust testing framework with \textbf{Pytest} covering over 168 test cases across AST, ST, and full output validation.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Keywords:} Python, Pytest, GitHub Actions, Makefile, CLI
