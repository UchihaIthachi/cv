\nointent \ProjectTitle{Employee Management System (EMS) (2025 | Individual) \hfill \href{https://github.com/UchihaIthachi/EMS}{\faGithub}}

 
\nointent Designed and built a comprehensive, cloud-native microservices application for employee and department management, featuring a full-stack architecture with a React/TypeScript frontend and Spring Boot backend. 
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architected a distributed system with independent microservices for employees, departments, and configuration, using \textbf{Spring Cloud} for service discovery (\textbf{Eureka}), centralized configuration, and an API gateway.
    \item Implemented robust fault tolerance using \textbf{Resilience4j}, incorporating \textbf{Circuit Breaker}, \textbf{Retry}, and \textbf{Rate Limiter} patterns to ensure system stability during partial failures.
    \item Enabled dynamic configuration management using \textbf{Spring Cloud Config Server} and \textbf{Spring Cloud Bus} with \textbf{RabbitMQ} for real-time property updates across services.
    \item Established a robust observability stack, integrating \textbf{Zipkin/Sleuth} for distributed tracing, the \textbf{ELK Stack} for centralized logging, and \textbf{Prometheus/Grafana} for real-time metrics and monitoring.
    \item Containerized all services using \textbf{Docker} and orchestrated local deployments with \textbf{Docker Compose}, while targeting \textbf{Kubernetes (OKE)} for production.
    \item Designed and managed a CI/CD pipeline using \textbf{GitHub Actions}, with \textbf{ArgoCD} for GitOps-based deployments to the Kubernetes cluster.
\end{itemize}
