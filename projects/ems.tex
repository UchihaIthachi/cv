Cloud-native microservices system for employee and department management, deployed on Oracle Kubernetes Engine with GitOps best practices.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed \textbf{Spring Boot} microservices (employee, department) with dedicated \textbf{MySQL} databases, service discovery via \textbf{Eureka/K8s DNS}, API gateway (\textbf{Spring Cloud Gateway}), and \textbf{RabbitMQ} for asynchronous messaging.
    \item Implemented observability with \textbf{Zipkin/Sleuth} tracing, structured \textbf{ELK} logging, \textbf{Prometheus} metrics, and \textbf{Grafana} dashboards.
    \item Authored production-grade \textbf{Kubernetes} manifests (Deployments, StatefulSets, Ingress, PVCs), configured \textbf{HPA} for auto-scaling, secured configs/secrets, and integrated with \textbf{OCI Load Balancer}.
    \item Automated builds and tests with \textbf{GitHub Actions}; deployed with \textbf{ArgoCD GitOps} for sync, rollback, and drift detection.
\end{itemize}
