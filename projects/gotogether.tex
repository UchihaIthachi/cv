Architected a \textbf{cloud-native, microservices-based} tourism platform for Sri Lanka featuring AI-driven itinerary generation (\textbf{Gemini API}), real-time transport tracking, and social engagement tools.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed independently deployable \textbf{microservices} for scalability, resilience, and fault isolation.
    \item Developed \textbf{Next.js} frontend with secure authentication, SSR/CSR hybrid rendering, and role-based route protection.
    \item Built \textbf{Spring Boot} User Service integrated with \textbf{Keycloak} for OAuth2/OIDC identity management.
    \item Automated identity provisioning with a dedicated Auth Service and realm/client setup scripts.
    \item Increased service startup reliability via a custom Keycloak dependency wait script.
    \item Configured \textbf{HTTPS} with NGINX, Certbot, and DuckDNS; optimized Docker builds with multi-stage pipelines.
    \item Migrated infrastructure from \textbf{AWS EC2} to \textbf{Oracle Cloud Free Tier}, improving performance while reducing costs.
\end{itemize}
