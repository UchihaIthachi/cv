Developed and deployed a full-stack travel assistant platform tailored for Sri Lankan tourism, offering AI-based itinerary generation, real-time transport data, and social interaction features through a cloud-native microservices architecture.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Led development of the web frontend using \textbf{Next.js} with secure authentication, session handling via HTTP-only cookies, SSR/CSR hybrid rendering, and route protection for role-based access.
    \item Designed and implemented the \textbf{User Service (Spring Boot)} to manage profiles, preferences, and social connections, integrating securely with \textbf{Keycloak} for identity management.
    \item Built a dedicated \textbf{Auth Service using Keycloak}, managing OAuth2/OIDC flows, token issuance, and automated realm/client boot-time import scripts.
    \item Solved startup dependency issues between services by writing a custom wait script to delay the user service until Keycloak initialization completed, improving reliability.
    \item Configured \textbf{HTTPS for production with NGINX + Certbot + DuckDNS}, ensuring compatibility with Vercel’s secure API policies.
    \item Refactored the Social Media Service, improving modularity, adding pagination, and enhancing error handling for REST APIs.
    \item Optimized container builds using .dockerignore and multi-stage Docker builds; manually built JARs outside Docker to reduce image size and speed up builds.
    \item Created a robust \textbf{deploy.sh script} to support local builds, selective service orchestration, and GitHub Actions-based CI/CD.
    \item Migrated backend infrastructure from \textbf{AWS EC2 to Oracle Cloud Free Tier}, improving stability, memory headroom, and deployment speed.
