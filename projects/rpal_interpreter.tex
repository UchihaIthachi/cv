\subsection*{Rpal Interpreter  \href{https://github.com/malinduGamage/RPAL-Interpreter}{\faGithub}}
Built a functional language interpreter from scratch, showcasing advanced compiler and automata theory concepts.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented lexical analysis using finite automata and custom regex engine.
    \item Designed parser with pushdown automata for syntactic analysis.
    \item Evaluated programs via lambda calculus-based execution model.
    \item Manipulated AST and symbol tables using graph theory algorithms.
    \item Set up automated testing with \textbf{Pytest} and CI/CD pipeline via \textbf{GitHub Actions}.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Tech:} Python, Pytest, GitHub Actions, Makefile, CLI, Cygwin
