\textit{Final Year Research Project (Ongoing) — BSc (Hons) in Computer Science \& Engineering, University of Moratuwa}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and implementing a modular ZK-Rollup prototype to empirically study the performance and economic trade-offs of batching, sequencing, and data availability strategies on Ethereum Layer 2.
    \item Architecting a runtime-swappable ZK-Rollup framework with clearly separated modules for batching, sequencing, state execution, proving, and data availability, to support controlled, reproducible experimentation.
    \item Implementing core rollup components including an off-chain sequencer, a Sparse Merkle Tree–based state manager, zk-SNARK circuits in Circom, and Solidity bridge + verifier contracts deployed on Ethereum testnets.
    \item Building a dedicated benchmarking harness to drive synthetic workloads and measure throughput (TPS), latency, gas per transaction, and proof time under different configurations.
    \item Evaluating the impact of batch size and batch frequency, sequencer scheduling policies (e.g., FIFO vs fee/priority-based), and data availability modes (L1 calldata vs EIP-4844 blob transactions) on end-to-end performance and cost.
    \item Generating empirical trade-off curves (e.g., throughput vs latency vs gas/tx) and configuration insights to guide the economic optimization of ZK-Rollup systems in the post–EIP-4844 environment.
    \item Planning to release the prototype, benchmarking scripts, and datasets as open source to support future research on rollup scalability and protocol tuning.
