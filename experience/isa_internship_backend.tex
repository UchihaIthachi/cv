\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Engineered a distributed, high-throughput unique ID generator for Passenger Name Records (PNRs) using a Kafka-backed pool model, ensuring uniqueness and security across scaled instances.
    \item Optimized the PNR generation service to achieve **25+ PNRs/sec throughput** per node with **<100ms latency**.
    \item Architected and implemented a hybrid integration strategy by embedding a gRPC client and Kafka consumer into a legacy Java 8 monolith.
    \item Investigated and refactored inefficient Kafka Streams processing logic, building a proof-of-concept to validate a more efficient Producer-Consumer model.
    \item Developed dynamic, database-driven feature toggles to control PNR routing logic.
