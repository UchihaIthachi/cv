\textbf{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill \textit{Dec 2024 – May 2024} \\
\textit{Information Systems Associates (Pvt) Ltd — Aviation Technology Company}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Contributed to both \textbf{AeroOrder}, a revamped microservices-based product (\textit{Java 18, Spring Boot}), and \textbf{AeroMart}, the legacy stable Passenger Service System (\textit{Java 8, Ant}).
    \item Designed and deployed a modern \textbf{Passenger Name Record (PNR) generation system} in AeroOrder, replacing the legacy Oracle DB-based generator in AeroMart, ensuring randomness, GDS compliance, and high scalability.
    \item Exposed PNR generation as \textbf{gRPC services} for integration with AeroMart, enabling backward compatibility during phased migration.
    \item Developed \textbf{fallback logic and feature flags} to allow runtime switching between new and legacy services, ensuring uninterrupted operations and smooth migration.
    \item Implemented an \textbf{application-level pessimistic locking mechanism} to manage distributed concurrency safely under high load, replacing DB-level locking.
    \item Used manual \textbf{Kafka consumer polling} (instead of Kafka Streams) for precise control over message consumption, improving resilience and service decoupling.
    \item Researched and benchmarked \textbf{ID generation strategies} (UUID, Snowflake, Redis counters), lookup optimizations (Bloom filters, radix trees, Couchbase KV access), and distributed coordination patterns.
    \item Built a \textbf{threshold-based PNR pool refill scheduler} using Kafka-triggered events to maintain availability without collisions across multiple instances.
    \item Conducted \textbf{asynchronous load and performance testing} for Kafka-based order creation workflows (JMeter, Gatling), validating 25+ orders/sec throughput with acceptable latency, while using \textbf{Prometheus + Grafana} to monitor queue depth, pool refill rates, and latency metrics in real-time.
    \item Refactored \textbf{structured logging} across AeroOrder and AeroMart services, standardizing JSON output for Kibana searchability and adding correlation IDs for cross-service tracing.
    \item Participated in Agile ceremonies (stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives) and contributed to technical documentation on Confluence covering architecture, test plans, and operational guidelines.
