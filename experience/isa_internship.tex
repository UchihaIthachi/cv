\textbf{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill \textit{Dec 2024 – May 2025} \\
\textit{Information Systems Associates (Pvt) Ltd — Aviation Technology Company}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Contributed to both AeroOrder, a modern, microservices-based revamp of the company's core product, and AeroMart, the complex, monolithic legacy Passenger Service System (PSS) it replaces. My work involved debugging the legacy Java 8 codebase of AeroMart to ensure seamless integration and backward compatibility during the phased migration to AeroOrder.
    \item As part of the AeroOrder team, focused on system design and R\&D for a distributed unique ID generator for Passenger Name Records (PNRs), incorporating aviation domain knowledge such as GDS-compliant rules (e.g., 6-character alphanumeric format excluding 'I' and 'O' for readability); ensured uniqueness, security, and conflict-free assignment across horizontally scaled instances using a Kafka-backed PNR pool model with state transitions (AVAILABLE → PROCESSING → USED/REJECTED), gaining skills in backend engineering, distributed systems, secure service design, and asynchronous communication.
    \item Optimized PNR generation service to achieve 25+ PNRs/sec throughput per node in a distributed environment, with low-latency retrieval (<100ms) and high concurrency; performed soak, load, stress, and spike testing to validate performance using Apache JMeter, simulating production-like spikes in staging and production environments, confirming no duplicates or reordering under stress; also conducted unit testing with JUnit, achieving passing SonarQube code coverage and quality gates.
    \item Resolved production issues in the PNR system, including Kafka consumer lag and offset resetting due to infrastructure failures (e.g., broker downtime or memory leaks); implemented fixes like proper consumer shutdown hooks and enhanced retry mechanisms to ensure fault tolerance and recoverability.
    \item Integrated gRPC client and a Kafka consumer into the legacy AeroMart system to enable communication with AeroOrder; added dynamic fallback logic to revert to Oracle DB sequence-based generator during timeouts or errors, converting numeric sequences to predictable base-34 alphanumeric PNRs using hash and permutation algorithms.
    \item Implemented configurable feature toggles via an application parameter table in AeroMart's Oracle database, allowing granular control over PNR routing (e.g., by sales channel, airport, or hub); enabled smooth hybrid integration for phased rollout in production, minimizing risk with options for full cutover or fallback while maintaining eventual consistency.
    \item Led R\&D for asynchronous order flow load testing between AeroMart and AeroOrder; set up Prometheus for metric collection (e.g., queue time, processing time, latency) and Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring.
    \item Investigated and refactored Kafka Streams processing in production to address consumer lag caused by inefficient validation logic; compared Kafka Producer-Consumer model with Streams framework, built a demo project to explore concepts like stateless/stateful transformations and exactly-once semantics, reducing lag and improving overall system stability.
    \item Refactored logging mechanism to implement structured JSON logging across services, removing dependencies like MessageSource for better efficiency.
    \item Authored comprehensive documentation on Confluence, including PNR service design (with ER/sequence diagrams), integration/cutover plans, and logging guidelines; conducted knowledge transfer sessions, demos, and presentations to the AeroOrder team for seamless handover.
    \item Participated in agile ceremonies, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog grooming, and code reviews via Jira and Bitbucket; collaborated with cross-functional teams to prioritize tasks, resolve blockers, and deliver production-ready features.
