\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0.3em, topsep=0.01em]

    \item \textbf{AeroOrder --- Revamped Order Management Microservice (Java 18, Spring Boot)}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.2em, topsep=0.1em]
        \item Engineered a \textbf{distributed}, \textbf{high-throughput} unique ID generator for Passenger Name Records (PNRs) using a \textbf{Kafka}-backed pool model, ensuring uniqueness and security across scaled instances while adhering to aviation domain standards.
        \item Optimized the PNR generation service to achieve \textbf{25+ PNRs/sec throughput} per node with \textbf{<100ms latency}, validating performance and resilience through extensive load, stress, and spike testing with \textbf{Apache JMeter}.
        \item Resolved critical \textbf{production} issues, including \textbf{Kafka} consumer lag and offset resetting, by implementing robust shutdown hooks and enhanced retry mechanisms to improve fault tolerance and system recoverability.
        \item Led \textbf{Research and Development} for \textbf{asynchronous load testing}, establishing a monitoring stack with \textbf{Prometheus} and \textbf{Grafana} to collect and visualize key performance metrics like queue time and latency.
        \item Investigated and refactored inefficient \textbf{Kafka Streams} processing logic, building a proof-of-concept to validate a more efficient \textbf{Producer-Consumer} model that significantly reduced consumer lag and improved system stability.
        \item Modernized the logging infrastructure by implementing structured \textbf{JSON logging}, which removed legacy dependencies and improved log parsing efficiency across all microservices.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{AeroMart — Legacy Monolithic Passenger Reservation System (Java 8 ,Ant )}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.2em, topsep=0.1em]
        \item Architected and implemented a hybrid integration strategy by embedding a \textbf{gRPC} client and \textbf{Kafka} consumer into a \textbf{legacy} \textbf{Java 8} monolith (AeroMart), enabling seamless, backward-compatible communication with the new \textbf{AeroOrder microservices} platform.
        \item Developed dynamic, database-driven \textbf{feature toggles} to control PNR routing logic, minimizing risk during the phased \textbf{production rollout} by allowing for granular control and immediate fallback.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Other}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.2em, topsep=0.1em]
        \item Authored comprehensive \textbf{design documents}, \textbf{sequence diagrams}, and \textbf{integration plans} on Confluence; facilitated knowledge transfer sessions to ensure seamless handover to the core development team.
        \item Actively contributed to the \textbf{agile development lifecycle}, participating in all ceremonies, performing \textbf{code reviews}, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver \textbf{production-ready} features using \textbf{Jira} and \textbf{Bitbucket}.
