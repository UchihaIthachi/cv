    \item Resolved critical production issues, including Kafka consumer lag and offset resetting, by implementing robust shutdown hooks and enhanced retry mechanisms to improve fault tolerance and system recoverability.
    \item Led Research and Development for asynchronous load testing, establishing a monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize key performance metrics like queue time and latency.
    \item Modernized the logging infrastructure by implementing structured JSON logging, which removed legacy dependencies and improved log parsing efficiency across all microservices.
    \item Developed dynamic, database-driven feature toggles to control PNR routing logic, minimizing risk during the phased production rollout by allowing for granular control and immediate fallback.
    \item Containerized all services using \textbf{Docker} and orchestrated local deployments with \textbf{Docker Compose}.
